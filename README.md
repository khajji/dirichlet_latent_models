# dirichlet_latent_models
contains a python implementation of Latent Variable Probabilistc Models.

Contains a python implementation of:
- LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) with Gibbs Sampling inference
- DLMR (Dirichlet Latent Multimoddal Representation) with Gibbs Sampling inference

DLMR is a model that is inspired from LDA, that I developed for my master thesis. It works for a multimodal dataset. Read more about DLMR in Dirichlet Latent Multimodal Representation (DLMR).pdf
